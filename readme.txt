A simple plugin that will facilitate the use of WebP images on your website.

== Description ==

The WebP plugin automatically creates a copy in the WebP format when you add a jpg, png or gif via media library. In addition, you have the option of adding alternatives to all already existing files in the available image extensions.

The plugin does not use external services and all photos are converted on your server. However, remember that you must have the php_gd2.dll library installed.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* PHP version 5.6.28 or greater (PHP 7.2 or greater is recommended)
* WordPress version 5.0.0 or greater (WordPress 5.2.3 or greater is recommended)

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WebP, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type WebP and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. ([WinSCP for example](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)) The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Does the plugin connect to other services? =

No. This plugin uses the php_gd2.dll library functions to process the jpeg image.
Everything is done on your server.
[Here you can learn more about GD](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.image.php)

= There was an error about the lack of support for functions. What can I do? =

Contact your administrator regarding the GD library.

= Do the creators of the plugin collect any information about me? =

No, the plugin does all the work on your site. No data is collected by us.
